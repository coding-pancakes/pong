# Pong w/ Pygame 🏓
## About!
👾 This project was built with Python/Pygame. The left paddle is controlled by using keys w(UP) and s(DOWN).  The right paddle is controlled with the up and down arrows.  Can be played single player but is more fun with a friend!

## How I Build It:
👩🏻‍💻 I built this project following the "Build Pong with Pygame" project tutorial on Codedex. I changed the color of the paddles to be purple instead of white.
